When is the <App> being re-render 

import reactLogo from './assets/react.svg'
import viteLogo from '/vite.svg'
import './App.css'

function App() {
  console.log("App rendered") // prints two times because its on strict mode in main.jsx only in development but it won't happen in production 
  const [value, setValue] = useState(1)

  const clickMe = () => {
    console.log("logeed");
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Question 2 </h1>
      <h2>Main value:{value}</h2>
      <button
