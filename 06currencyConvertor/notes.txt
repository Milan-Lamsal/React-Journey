Currency Converter - Detailed Explanation 
=================================================

1. WHAT IS THIS PROGRAM?
------------------------
This is a web application that helps you convert money from one currency to another (like converting US Dollars to Euros). It's built using React, which is a popular tool for making interactive websites.

2. HOW DOES IT WORK? (Step by Step)
----------------------------------
A. When the App Starts:
   - The app creates an empty space for you to type an amount ('')
   - It sets NPR (Nepalese Rupee) as the default "from" currency
   - It sets USD (US Dollar) as the default "to" currency
   - It prepares to show you the converted amount (also starts empty)

B. Getting Currency Rates:
   - The app uses something called a "custom hook" (useCurrencyInfo)
   - This hook is like a helper that goes to the internet and gets the latest currency rates
   - It uses this API: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@fawazahmed0/currency-api@latest
   - Every time you change the "from" currency, it gets new rates

C. The Main Parts (Components):
   1. Input Box Component (appears twice on screen):
      - First one: where you type the amount you want to convert
      - Second one: where you see the converted amount
      - Each box has:
         * A label ("From" or "To")
         * A place to type numbers
         * A dropdown menu to select currencies
         * Special styling to make it look nice

   2. Swap Button:
      - Sits between the two input boxes
      - When clicked, it switches the currencies
      - Example: If converting USD to EUR, clicking swap makes it EUR to USD

   3. Convert Button:
      - Big button at the bottom
      - When clicked, it does the actual conversion
      - Uses the formula: your amount × exchange rate = converted amount

3. THE CLEVER BITS (Special Features)
-----------------------------------
A. State Management:
   - The app remembers four important things (using useState):
     1. amount: what you type in
     2. from: which currency you're converting from
     3. to: which currency you're converting to
     4. convertedAmount: the result after conversion

B. Real-time Updates:
   - When you change the "from" currency, it automatically fetches new rates
   - The conversion happens instantly when you click convert

C. Smart Design:
   - Uses glass-like effects (glassmorphism)
   - Dark theme with gradients
   - Responsive (looks good on phones and computers)
   - Smooth animations when you hover or click things

4. HOW THE CONVERSION WORKS (Example)
-----------------------------------
Let's say you want to convert 100 USD to EUR:

1. You type "100" in the first box
2. Select "USD" from the first dropdown
3. Select "EUR" from the second dropdown
4. Click "Convert"
5. Behind the scenes:
   - App looks up the exchange rate (let's say 1 USD = 0.85 EUR)
   - Multiplies your amount by the rate (100 × 0.85)
   - Shows 85 EUR in the second box

5. SPECIAL TERMS EXPLAINED
-------------------------
- useState: A React tool that helps remember information
- Props: Information passed between different parts of the app
- Custom Hook: A special function that can reuse code
- API: A way to get information from the internet
- Tailwind CSS: A tool that helps make the app look nice
- Component: A reusable piece of the app's interface

6. COOL FEATURES FOR USERS
-------------------------
- Can swap currencies with one click
- See real-time exchange rates
- Modern, easy-to-use interface
- Works on all devices
- Clear, visible buttons and inputs
- Smooth animations and transitions

7. ERROR HANDLING
----------------
- Only allows number inputs
- Automatically formats currencies
- Won't break if internet is slow
- Shows clear labels for all options

Remember: This app is like a calculator specifically for currencies. Instead of just adding or multiplying numbers, it helps you figure out how much your money is worth in different currencies around the world!

8. TIPS FOR USING
----------------
- Always check the currency symbols carefully
- Use the swap button to quickly reverse the conversion
- The rates are updated regularly, so you get accurate conversions
- You can type any amount you want to convert
- Use the dropdown menus to find your desired currencies
