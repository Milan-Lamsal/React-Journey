Important concept = Environement Variables, System Variables why?
->Database, 
Environment variables are key-value pairs used to store sensitive or configurable information, such as API keys, database URLs, and environment-specific settings.
 Why are they important?

Security – Hides sensitive information (e.g., API keys) from being exposed in the source code.
Configuration Flexibility – Allows different settings for development, staging, and production environments.
Avoids Hardcoding – Prevents storing credentials directly in the codebase, making it reusable and manageable.

3️⃣ Using Environment Variables for Database Configuration
If you're connecting to a backend database (e.g., MongoDB, Firebase, Supabase), your React frontend should not store database credentials directly.
Instead:

Store database credentials only in the backend (e.g., Node.js, Express).
The frontend should only store the backend API URL.

onclusion
Use environment variables to manage app-specific configurations.
Never store database credentials in the frontend—use a backend server.
In Vite, always prefix environment variables with VITE_ to access them in React.

The environment variable should be in the Project root (such as Readme, Package.json is in project root but not the app.css)

dot(.) is the most important -> .env
-> This .env we never shift in github or in production so when pushing the simple way is to (we do add to .gitignore)

How to take access to the Environement Variable 
in backend , frontend they use different way to acces , react app way is different, vite is differenct , appwrite is different all over to access the environment variables are different ways 

-> Also we don't export in .env
 => to see  console.log(Process.env.REACT_APP_APPWRITE_URL);

 Environement variable files only load one time usually but if you add or remove then maximum cases you have to close the project and restart again
 
 if you create you environment varibale using " React Create App " then we need to use
 process.env.REACT_APP_NOT_SECRET_CODE => need to have "REACT_APP_"
 
 But we are using " Vite " Not React Create App" so we used
 -> VITE_ and Instead of process.env unlike in Creat React App we use (import.meta.env.VITE_)
 Accoding to documentation- >https://vite.dev/guide/env-and-mode 

 Now go to appwrite and create a project
 1)go to seeting and copy the API endpoin and paste in VITE_APPWRITE_URL= 
 2)then copy Project ID
 3)create database and get the id now in the database add create collection which is the table for datbase and then copy the id 
 4)then for the bucket Id get it from storage keep images and get id  

 Creating Config.js we export key value, cus we don't want to write import.meta.env everywhere 

 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Appwrite +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
-> Appwrite has many services such as database, authetication, upload, download 
https://appwrite.io/docs/products/databases/documents
 //Vendor lockin -> if you want to takout the authetication the app can still work so we make SERVICES 

 First we created appwrite folder and then
 they are backend  
 1)auth_service.js
 2)appwriteconfig.js  

 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Store ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 we need to import configureStore from reduxjs / toolkit
 import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const store = configureStore({
    reducer: {
    }
});

export default store; 

in store there is state and action , payload

============================================= Components ======================================================
1)Header
2)Footer
->import { Link } from 'react-router-dom'
index.js to export both Header and Footer

Dispatch comes from react-redux

Dispatch is the combination when react with redux 


In options you usually get array

  {...register} its a syntax not a spread
